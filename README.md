# Image Steganography using Python

This project implements a secure image-based steganography system to hide secret text inside an image using XOR encryption.

## 🔐 Overview
This project was developed during my Cyber Security Internship at Edunet Foundation.  
The system embeds encrypted text into image pixels while preserving image quality. The hidden message can only be extracted using the correct password.

## 🚀 Features
- Hide secret text inside an image
- Extract hidden message from image
- XOR-based encryption
- Password protection
- Maintains image integrity

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## ▶ How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install opencv-python numpy
2. Run the program:
   python image_steganography.py
3. Provide the input image and secret message when prompted.

## 📌 Applications
- Secure communication
- Data protection
- Cybersecurity research
